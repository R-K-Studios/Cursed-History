Okay. Mom's gone and all that she left me is this weird watch that goes backwards.
A box of old documents.
And a half-empty family tree.
She wants me to solve the mystery of the 'family curse'
Apparently people with the watch disappear mysteriously?
But no one knows where it came from.
Guess it's up to me to find out.
I got it from mom, and mom got it from her dad.
Who disappeared when she was super young...
My great grandfather had three sons, but we don't actually know who her dad was.
So I guess we'll start with finding out who he is?

It's not surprising for mom to disappear at a moment's notice...
I'm sure she'll be back. Curses aren't real.
...still, the tone of this note is...
...weird.
Also I don't think I've seen her sign her full name before.
Never knew that was her middle name.

I guess 'Hawke' was adopted.
Would a 'curse' even work on an adoptee?
Not that curses are real.

A letter written by my great grandfather Boris.
"Eldest living child" certainly applies to me and mom.
If we assume this is true, then...
whoever had the watch before her was the oldest brother, right?
Still guy must have been pretty supersticious to think the watch was actually cursed.

The watch is passed down to the eldest living child.
Mom seems to agree that the curse is nonsense.

Mom's dad disappeared after this incident?
I wonder if he was attacked by the dog.
It doesn't really tell me who owned the farm, though.
Maybe something else will let me know?

Mom never really reconnected to her dad's side of the family.
So I honestly don't know who this is.
Of course this doesn't look like mom's handwriting.
Which makes me think someone else's dad was adopted.

Looks like the watch really does stick to the family.
If mom's middle name is her maiden name, and Fox was the farm owner...
The only conclusion I can come to is that Mom's dad was Loupe Wolfram.
But if she got it from him, then it didn't go to the eldest child.
Except it looks like Boris really wanted it to go to Hawke.
Heh, I guess curses really don't work through adoption.
Not that the curse is real...
Well, it would explain why I'm here and not Elias.
I feel like I'm missing something, though.
Why would you adopt someone just to inherit a watch..?
And what exactly happened on that farm that night?
I wonder if I can learn more by looking up that newspaper.
Or maybe there's more clues in these other boxes?
===

Hmm if I think of Elias in relation to this adoption paper...
Then I guess Hawke adopted his son...?
Wait... does that make sense?

I think Elias wrote this note.

According to Boris's Letter, the eldest living child should get the watch.
Which means Elias's or his kids have the watch!
...Uh...?

Maybe Elias has something to do with this incident.

What if this is Elias's handwriting?
If his dad's parents adopted him, then I wonder why he made note of this picture.
Was he looking into his dad's adoption?
I guess that detail doesn't matter.

I wonder if Hawke was mom's dad.
That'd make her maiden name 'Channon', wouldn't it?
I don't think I've ever heard that, but that guess is as good as any.

Boris says something about a sacrifice..?
What a weird way to say that.
But if the letter says he wanted Hawke to have it, then Hawke must have inherited it right?
===

I'm guessing Hawke wrote this note.
Then again he refers to himself by name here.
That's a little weird.
===

Maybe Hawke wrote on this photo.
Was Boris adopted?
I don't think I have anything here to prove that.

I... don't know if that's important information.

Loupe has to be either the farmer or the one who disappeared.
Do I already know who the farmer is?

Could Loupe be a farmer?
He doesn't seem the type, from his photo.
But books and covers.
Hmm, maybe I should look closer at this note.

I can see the family resemblance.
There doesn't seem to be much relating to Loupe directly in mom's note though.
This doesn't tell me anything.
===

Loupe was Boris's first naturally born son.
He seems to think Loupe getting the watch is inevitable.
Which is weird considering how inheretance usually works...
Not sure if this really helps me.
===

Did Loupe write this?
Was Boris adopted?
I don't think I can prove that either way.

By the names used, Fox is either the farmer or the one who disappeared.
If there's a way to prove who owned the farm, that'd be helpful.
===

Well, Loupe and Hawke are named in this note.
Makes sense to assume this was written by Fox.
So Fox was a farmer, huh?

Well if Fox is my grandpa, Boris would be pretty upset about it.
I guess it's safe to assume something would have had to happen to Loupe for that to happen.
So I can see why.
What does this tell me though?

Mom's middle name was "Wolfram"?
I guess she might have moved her maiden name.
