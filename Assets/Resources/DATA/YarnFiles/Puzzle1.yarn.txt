Okay. Mom's gone and all that she left me is this weird watch that goes backwards.
A box of old documents.
And a half-empty family tree.
She wants me to solve the mystery of the 'family curse'
Apparently people with the watch disappear mysteriously?
But no one knows where it came from.
Guess it's up to me to find out.
I got it from mom, and mom got it from her dad.
Who disappeared when she was super young...
My great grandfather had three sons, but we don't actually know who her dad was.
So I guess we'll start with finding out who he is?

It's not surprising for mom to disappear at a moment's notice...
I'm sure she'll be back. Curses aren't real.
...still, the tone of this note is...
...weird.
Also I don't think I've seen her sign her full name before.
Never knew that was her middle name.

Adoption Papers...?
I guess 'Hawke' was adopted.
Would a 'curse' even work on an adoptee?
Not that curses are real.

A letter written by my great grandfather Boris.
"Eldest living child" certainly applies to me and mom.
If we assume this is true, then...
whoever had the watch before her was the oldest brother, right?
Still guy must have been pretty supersticious to think the watch was actually cursed.

The watch is passed down to the eldest living child.
Mom seems to agree that the curse is nonsense.

Mom's dad disappeared after this incident?
I wonder if he was attacked by the dog.
It doesn't really tell me who owned the farm, though.
Maybe something else will let me know?

The night grandpa disappeared, the farm was attacked by a dog.
I guess he didn't run the farm though.

Looks like a todo list.
Stuff that you do on a farm?
Looks like this didn't belong to Hawke or Loupe.

Mom never really reconnected to her dad's side of the family.
So I honestly don't know who this is.
Of course this doesn't look like mom's handwriting.
Which makes me think someone else's dad was adopted.

Looks like the watch really does stick to the family.
If mom's middle name is her maiden name, and Fox was the farm owner...
The only conclusion I can come to is that Mom's dad was Loupe Wolfram.
But if she got it from him, then it didn't go to the eldest child.
Except it looks like Boris really wanted it to go to Hawke.
Heh, I guess curses really don't work through adoption.
Not that the curse is real...
Well, it would explain why I'm here and not Elias.
I feel like I'm missing something, though.
Why would you adopt someone just to inherit a watch..?
And what exactly happened on that farm that night?
I wonder if I can learn more by looking up that newspaper.
Or maybe there's more clues in these other boxes?
