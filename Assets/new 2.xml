		Hey this is where we type our bio text. We can do lots of cool stuff in here too!
		Formatting is mostly handled for us, so feel free to indent as you want. If you
		want to tell the game that there has to be a space somewhere, you can do so with the 
		"<br>" tag. 
		<br>
		<br>
		When you're writting, there are a few other tags you can use. These include "<u>", "<bold>", and "<i>". 
		So if you wanted <bold>The following text to be bold</bold> you can type it within those tags. 
		If you want text to be in italics, <i> you just put it in the i tag<i>
		<br>
		<br>
		So, lets say you want some text to only appear whenever some flag is set. There's two ways you can make this happen!
		First, for either method, you need to use the "<when>" get the correct flag name. for our example, we'll use a tag named "cool". 
		If you want some special text to show up only when this person has the "cool" tag set to true
		<when flag="cool">, you can write something like this. Now whenever the "cool" flag is set, this text will show up.</when>
		<when flag="cool" invert> you can add "invert" to your tag to make it so that this text only shows up whenever the flag isnt' set</when>
		<br>
		<br>
		Now, if there's some text that you want to show up for more than one person, there's a way to do this! 
		First, when the flag is created in "Flag.CSV", write the line of text within it's "bio" field. 
		Then you can access it just by typing <when flag="cool"/>
